nbdkit-release-notes-1.42 - release notes for nbdkit 1.42

=head1 DESCRIPTION

These are the release notes for nbdkit stable release 1.42.
This describes the major changes since 1.40.

nbdkit 1.42.0 was released on B<XXX XXX 2025>.

=head2 Security

L<nbdkit-ip-filter(1)> has been fixed to prevent banned clients from
listing out exports in some situations.

All past security issues and information about how to report new ones
can be found in L<nbdkit-security(1)>.

=head2 Plugins

L<nbdkit-ondemand-plugin(1)> now allows more characters to appear in
filenames, allowing in particular filenames containing MAC addresses
to be used, which is useful when using NBD in pre-boot environments.
Also add the C<share=true> option to allow sharing.  (Thanks Markus
Hartung)

L<nbdkit-vddk-plugin(1)> now prints the default list of transports in
I<--dump-plugin> output.  Also this plugin now handles partial chunks
correctly when reading extents for disks with a non-aligned size
(thanks Ming Xie).

=head2 Filters

New L<nbdkit-time-limit-filter(1)> can be used to specify the maximum
time limit for a connection.  (See also the new I<--timeout> option
below).

New L<nbdkit-lzip-filter(1)> which implements support for random
access to lzip-compressed files (Jan Felix Langenbach).

=head2 Language bindings

Multiple updates to L<nbdkit-rust-plugin(1)> to keep up to date with
latest changes in the Rust language (Alan Somers).

Fix crash that happened in OCaml plugins with OCaml E<ge> 5 (thanks
Guillaume Munch-Maccagnoni, Gabriel Scherer).  Also update the
ocamldoc documentation.  Fix more OCaml 5 deprecation warnings.

Add support for Tcl 9.0.

=head2 Server

nbdkit will now try to send the last plugin error message over the NBD
protocol to the client, to provide additional information.  This
requires an NBD client which supports this, such as qemu E<ge> 2.12 or
libnbd E<ge> 1.22.

New nbdkit I<--timeout> flag can be used as a security measure to
ensure that clients don't consume resources by opening lots of
connections and then not negotiating (or negotiating slowly) the full
NBD session.

New nbdkit I<--keepalive> option which enables TCP-level keepalives.
This is useful for detecting when the client does away.
