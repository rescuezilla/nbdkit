nbdkit-release-notes-1.44 - release notes for nbdkit 1.44

=head1 DESCRIPTION

These are the release notes for nbdkit stable release 1.44.
This describes the major changes since 1.42.

nbdkit 1.44.0 was released on B<XXX XXX 2025>.

=head2 Security

Fix off-by-one for maximum block_status length (CVE-2025-47711), and a
32-bit overflow in extents handing (CVE-2025-47712) (reported by
Nikolay Ivanets and Eric Blake, and fixed by Eric Blake).

Thread-local storage is now used when printing certain protocol
messages in verbose mode, which avoids possible output corruption.
The existing code was examined to see if this could have been a
security problem, but it is not thought so.

=head2 Plugins

New L<nbdkit-nfs-plugin(1)> which allows access to disk images stored
on NFS servers (thanks Ronnie Sahlberg).

L<nbdkit-file-plugin(1)> is now much more careful about checking for
errors from certain Linux system calls that we previously thought were
just advisory (thanks Eric Sandeen, Dave Chinner).

L<nbdkit-file-plugin(1)> can now trim LVM thin block devices (thanks
Germano Veit Michel, Eric Blake).

L<nbdkit-curl-plugin(1)> adds new C<proxy-cafile> and C<proxy-capath>
parameters (Adi Aloni).

L<nbdkit-vddk-plugin(1)> adds a new C<export> parameter which allows
the client to choose which file to serve via the NBD protocol export
name.  This plugin has also been optimized so that querying extent
information no longer slows down reads.  Debugging information has
also be improved, and we can now track the time taken to run
asynchronous commands.

L<nbdkit-info-plugin(1)> adds a new C<mode=version> method.

L<nbdkit-torrent-plugin(1)> now supports prefetching.  This plugin now
also generates additional information in I<--dump-plugin> output.

L<nbdkit-data-plugin(1)> allows C<@offset> to use scaling suffixes,
eg. C<@4M> to move the offset to 4194304 (Eric Blake).

=head2 Filters

New L<nbdkit-openonce-filter(1)> which can be used to open the
underlying plugin once, sharing the plugin across connections.

L<nbdkit-cacheextents-filter(1)> I<has been deprecated>, and is
expected to be removed in S<nbdkit 1.46>.

L<nbdkit-cow-filter(1)> now understands that the NBD protocol export
name causes multiple disk images to be exported, and correctly creates
an overlay per export.

L<nbdkit-ext2-filter(1)> now permits concurrent client connections
(Eric Blake).

L<nbdkit-fua-filter(1)> adds a new C<flush-on-close=true> flag which
can be used to force a flush to persistent storage when the connection
closes even if the client does not request one.

L<nbdkit-blocksize-policy-filter(1)> will now round unaligned extents
from plugins.  Also adjust C<blocksize-error-policy=error> to allow
access to the unaligned tail of the disk image, but at the same time
add new C<blocksize-error-policy=strict-error> mode which can be used
to block that.  (Eric Blake).

=head2 Language bindings

L<Plugins written in golang|nbdkit-golang-plugin(3)> now issue a
warning if L<fork(2)> is called, since that will likely cause the
plugin to break.

In L<nbdkit-rust-plugin(3)>, clippy warnings are now tied to the
C<./configure --enable-gcc-warnings> flag.

=head2 Server

New I<--log=/path> option allowing error logging to be sent to a file.
Also new I<--log=default> option which just directs logging to the
default output (the same as if I<--log> is not used at all).

=head2 API

The filter API (which is not part of our API promise) changes the
C<.thread_model> call, allowing the current thread model to be changed
conditionally.

=head2 Documentation

Filters which are "export-safe" — that is, they correctly handle the
case where plugins serve different content depending on the NBD
protocol export name — are now documented in
L<nbdkit-protocol(1)/EXPORT-SAFE FILTERS>.

A common macro is used for all references in the documentation to
magic parameters.

=head2 Tests

The particularly long-running C<test-spinning-mkfs.sh> test has been
modified to finish more quickly.

Previously running the whole test suite would leave many
F</tmp/nbdkitXXXXXX> temporary directories over.  These have been
reduced although not quite eliminated.

=head2 Build

The C<./configure> output has been beautified, which also helps to
highlight problems when glancing at the output.

Fix build issues with GCC 15.

Allow User Statically Defined Tracing (USDT) probes to be added into
the server.  Few actual probes are added so far, but the build system
has been modified to allow it.

L<nbdkit-vddk-plugin(1)> now requires minimum VDDK E<ge> 6.7.

Builds on clang were complaining about unused I<-pthread> option.
This warning has been fixed (Eric Blake).

=head2 Internals

In Python code, remove unnecessary C<global> statements.

L<nbdkit-file-plugin(1)> now produces more detailed information in
error messages, particularly about the file being accessed and the
offset and size of the request that failed.

In debug mode, when the server starts up it prints a debug message
summarising the flow of request processing through filters and the
plugin, making this easier to understand.
