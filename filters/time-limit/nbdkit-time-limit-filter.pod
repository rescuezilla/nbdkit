=head1 NAME

nbdkit-time-limit-filter - set an overall time limit for each connection

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 nbdkit --filter=time-limit PLUGIN [time-limit=TIME]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<nbdkit-time-limit-filter> is an L<nbdkit(1)> filter that sets an
overall limit on the length of time that a client may be connected
for.  After this time limit is exceeded, client commands are rejected
and we attempt to disconnect the client.

B<Note:> because of current limitations in the filter API, a client
can hold an idle connection open for longer than the time limit.  The
time limit is only enforced when the client sends a command to the
server.
