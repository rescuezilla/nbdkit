=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<nbdkit-delay-filter> is a filter for L<nbdkit(1)> that delays read
and write requests.  This is used to simulate a slow or remote server,
or to test certain kinds of race conditions in Linux.  To limit server
bandwidth use L<nbdkit-rate-filter(1)> instead.  To simulate a
spinning disk see L<nbdkit-spinning-filter(1)>.

=head1 EXAMPLES

Delays reads and writes by 100ms:

 nbdkit --filter=delay file disk.img rdelay=100ms wdelay=100ms

Delay only zero operations by 1 second, nothing else is affected:

 nbdkit --filter=delay file disk.img delay-zero=1

=head1 DELAY FORMAT

In nbdkit E<ge> 1.40, L<nbdkit_parse_delay(3)> is used to parse the
delay parameters, so a wide variety of formats are accepted, such as:

=over 4

=item delay-read=1.5

=item delay-write=100ms

=item delay-zero=1.2Î¼s

=item delay-trim=1000ns

=back

In nbdkit E<le> 1.38, only a whole number of seconds, or a whole
number of milliseconds (if suffixed by C<ms>) were allowed.

=head1 PARAMETERS

=over 4

=item B<rdelay=>DELAY

=item B<delay-read=>DELAY

Delay read operations by C<DELAY>.

The two forms C<rdelay> and C<delay-read> work identically.

=item B<delay-write=>DELAY

Delay write operations by C<DELAY>.

=item B<delay-zero=>DELAY

(nbdkit E<ge> 1.10)

Delay zero operations by C<DELAY>.  See also B<delay-fast-zero>.

=item B<delay-trim=>DELAY

(nbdkit E<ge> 1.10)

Delay trim/discard operations by C<DELAY>.

=item B<delay-extents=>DELAY

(nbdkit E<ge> 1.12)

Delay block status (extents) operations by C<DELAY>.

=item B<delay-cache=>DELAY

(nbdkit E<ge> 1.14)

Delay advisory cache operations by C<DELAY>.

=item B<wdelay=>DELAY

Delay write, zero and trim operations by C<DELAY>.

=item B<delay-fast-zero=>BOOL

(nbdkit E<ge> 1.16)

The NBD specification documents an extension called fast zero, in
which the client may request that a server should reply with
C<ENOTSUP> as soon as possible if the zero operation offers no real
speedup over a corresponding write.  By default, this parameter is
true, and fast zero requests are serviced by the plugin after the same
delay as any other zero request; but setting this parameter to false
instantly fails a fast zero response without waiting for or consulting
the plugin.

=item B<delay-open=>DELAY

(nbdkit E<ge> 1.28)

Delay open (client connection) by C<DELAY>.

=item B<delay-close=>DELAY

(nbdkit E<ge> 1.28)

Delay close (client disconnection) by C<DELAY>.  This can also cause
server shutdown to be delayed if clients are connected at the time.
This only affects clients that gracefully disconnect (using
C<NBD_CMD_DISC> / libnbd function L<nbd_shutdown(3)>).  Clients that
abruptly disconnect from the server cannot be delayed.

=head1 FILES

=over 4

=item F<$filterdir/nbdkit-delay-filter.so>

The filter.

Use C<nbdkit --dump-config> to find the location of C<$filterdir>.

=head1 VERSION

C<nbdkit-delay-filter> first appeared in nbdkit 1.2, based on earlier
C<rdelay> and C<wdelay> options in L<nbdkit-file-plugin(1)>.
